# bellmanFord
A C++ implementation of the single-source shortest-path algorithm called Bermann-Ford. Done from scratch, using only the standard library and structs to emulate a graph.

When executed, the algorithm finds the weight value of the shortest path from vertex 2 to each one the vertices of the graph depicted bellow:

This is a work in progress.
